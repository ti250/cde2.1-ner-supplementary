# Python modules for NER training

This folder contains code to read the datasets tokenized using the files in `chemdner_tokenise_iob` when training AllenNLP files. The code was adapted from [two](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allenai/scibert/master/scibert/models/bert_crf_tagger.py) [main](https://medium.com/saarthi-ai/how-to-make-your-own-ner-model-with-contexual-word-embeddings-5086276e04a0) sources. These should be imported when running any training using AllenNLP.
